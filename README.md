# MasterThesisData
Here is the data that I had been used for my Master Thesis in Saarland University, Germany. There are:
- a data from prompting mechanisms, and modes and tasks itself, what has been prompted and the raw data from ChatGPT4;
- analysis and the data from the analysis that I did in MAXQDA software (also segments of the codes that had been used for the analysis, Top-Level Codes, Matrix Browser, etc.);
- validation of the tasks - form that had been made from the Math book that had been used for reserach (Saarland state only);
- data from grading a task
- excel files and analysis of the words that occured the most.
